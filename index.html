<h3>The Strip</h3>

<p>The Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard in Clark County, Nevada, that is known for its concentration of resort hotels and casinos. The Strip, as it is known, is about 4.2 mi (6.8 km) long,[1] and is immediately south of the Las Vegas city limits in the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester, but is often referred to simply as "Las Vegas".

    Many of the largest hotel, casino, and resort properties in the world are on the Strip, known for its contemporary architecture, lights, and wide variety of attractions. Its hotels, casinos, restaurants, residential high-rises, entertainment offerings, and skyline have established the Strip as one of the most popular and iconic tourist destinations in the world and is one of the driving forces for Las Vegas's economy.[2] Most of the Strip has been designated as an All-American Road,[3] and the North and South Las Vegas Strip routes are classified as Nevada Scenic Byways and National Scenic Byways.[4]

    Historically, casinos that were not in Downtown Las Vegas along Fremont Street sat outside the city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard.[5][6] In 1959, the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was built[7] exactly 4.5 miles (7.2 km) outside the city limits. The sign is currently located in the median just south of Russell Road, across from the location of the now-demolished Klondike Hotel and Casino and about 0.4 miles (0.64 km) south of the southernmost entrance to Mandalay Bay, which is the Strip's southernmost casino.
    
    In the strictest sense, "the Strip" refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road, a distance of 4.2 miles (6.8 km).[8][9][10] Clark County uses the phrase Resort Corridor to describe the area including Las Vegas Boulevard betw</p>


<h3>More places to visit</h3>

<p>Flashing neon signs, slot machines, and billboards about upcoming comedians and star performers are your greeters when you deplane at Harry Reid International Airport. Truth is, for a city that never sleeps, there’s no way to catch it all during your trip. Lucky for you, Southwest® flies to Las Vegas often. Get your visit started with a walk down The Strip to see iconic hotels and casinos, belly up to a buffet table for a feast, and plan outdoor adventures unlike any you’d encounter at home.</p>
